the defenition of the growth mindset is the one that reach great achevemnt and high goals.
the growth mindset believe that we can develop our skills by hard work. it has a passion towards learning.
on the other hand, a fixed mindset belives that the abilities of our brains can't be developed and they are fixed traits.

people who have fixed mindset avoid challenges, but people with growth mindset face them and consider them as a chance to shine .
only losers sleep for long hours . mistakes in any job are **must**
but instead of giving up we must find the roots of the problem and try to fix it.
Also we should make use of our jealousy from successful people by knowing that they reach thier goals by hard work.

   also we always remember the short hard times will disappear and the good result will stay for the rest of our lives. :wink:
